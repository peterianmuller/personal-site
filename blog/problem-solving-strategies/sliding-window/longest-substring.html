    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>
      "findLongestSubstring accepts a string and returns the length of the
      longest substring with all distinct characters"
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a problem that requires a dynamic sized window. We also get to use
      an extrernal data structure to keep track of the last time that we have
      seen a certain character
    </p>

    <pre>findLongestSubstring('rithmschool')</pre>

    <p>
      Should yeild us 7 which is the length of the substring
      <span class="inline-code">'rithmsc'</span>. This substring stops at the
      next h character because we already have seen an h.
    </p>

    <p>
      A way to think about this with the perscpective of the sliding window is
      that we could have one pointer, i, at the start of the string and another
      pointer, j, incrementing by one.
    </p>

    <pre>
'rithmschool'
 i 
 j
    </pre>

    <p>
      We could also keep track of each character we've seen at each index via an
      object. As we increment the j pointer we populate the object. All is well
      and good until we get to the second h. We can also figure out the longest
      substring of non-repeating characters each time we iterate j
    </p>

    <pre>
longest = j - i + 1
longrst = 6 - 0 + 1 = 7          
seen = {'r':0, 'i': 1, 't':2, 'h':3, 'm':4, 's':5, 'c':6}

'rithmschool'
 i 
       j
    </pre>

    <p>
      Now what happens when we reach that second 'h'? At this point we need to
      move our start pointer up. We'll move it to the previous character we've
      seen and then move it up once
    </p>

    <pre>

    'rithmschool'
     i 
           j

    // Move j up to the second h and check seen object
    let j = 7
    str[j] = 'h'
    seen[j] = 3
    i = 3 + 1     

    'rithmschool'
         i 
            j

    </pre>

    <p>Then we move up j and we do end up encountering two 'o' characters:</p>

    <pre>
    seen = {'r':0, 'i': 1, 't':2, 'h':7, 'm':4, 's':5, 'c':6, 'o':8}

   'rithmschool'
        i 
            j

    // Increment j
    let j = 9
    str[j] = 'o'
    seen['o'] = 8
    i = 8 + 1 = 9

     'rithmschool'
               i 
              j
    </pre>

    <p>Hence our code could look like:</p>

    <pre>

function findLongestSubstring(str) {
  let start = 0,
    end = 0,
    seen = {},
    longest = 0;
  while (end < str.length) {
    let char = str[end];
    if (seen.hasOwnProperty(char)) {
      start = seen[char] + 1;
    }
    seen[char] = end;
    longest = Math.max(longest, end - start + 1);
    end++;
  }
  return longest;
}
    </pre>

    <p>Ok Nice! Let's talk though a few examples</p>

    <p>What about the following exmaple:</p>

    <pre>findLongestSubstring('longestSubstring')</pre>

    <p>
      The issue here is that if we reassign start to the last time we saw a
      character (plus one) We actually could be moving our start to the left.
      This leads to a larger window than is correct.
    </p>

    <pre>

function findLongestSubstring(str) {
  let start = 0,
    end = 0,
    seen = {},
    longest = 0;
  while (end < str.length) {
    let char = str[end];
    if (seen.hasOwnProperty(char)) {
      start = Math.max(start, seen[char] + 1)
      //start = seen[char] + 1;
    }
    seen[char] = end;
    longest = Math.max(longest, end - start + 1);
    end++;
  }
  return longest;
}
    </pre>
