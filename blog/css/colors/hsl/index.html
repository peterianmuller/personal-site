		<p>The hue channel in hsl starts at 0 for red, then passes through a journey of various other colors on our way to 360: orange, yellow, green, blue etc. You can now follow the journey on Chrome's new dev tools' new color picker</p>

		<p>The saturation is a percentage and goes from a 0% giving an appearence of grey, to 100% which is the fullness of the color. Saturation === color vs. grey scale. If we keep the lightness and hue values the same, increasing the saturation will move the color away from grey and towards a more full color. Our boxes here have more full color, and a higher saturation % moving from l to right</p>

		<div class="not-full"></div>
		<div class="fuller"></div>
		<div class="fullest"></div>

		<p>l, or the lightness channel is also a percentage and refers goes from 0% (black) to 100% (white). </p>

		<p>I thought of exporing hsl as a conduit to the conundrum of light and dark colors. What we can see here is that there are different ways of attaining lightness and darkness through the saturation and lightness channels</p>


		<div class="not-light"></div>
		<div class="lighter"></div>
		<div class="lightest"></div>
