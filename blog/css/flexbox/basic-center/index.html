	<h1>A dope trick to center an item on the page!</h1>

	<p>Thanks to Chris Coyer aka the GOAT, we can think about flexbox via some of the problems it solves. Centering an item on a page for one. Note that here we have both vertical and horizontal centering. Before we would have had to use margin: auto for horinzontal centering and perhaps line-height or some other way of centering elements vertically.</p>
