  <p>One way that we can make a background-image not repeat is the classic:
    <pre>background-size: cover;</pre>However, when we resize an page that only has this rule, the im age could potentially repeat. What we can do is ensure that the html element covers 100% of the page:</p>
  <pre>
  html {
		height: 100%;
	}</pre>
</body>
