	<h2>N in :nth-of-type and N in :nth-child</h2>

	<p>There are some numbering systems in cimputer science that are 0-indexed: perhaps the most quotidian the lovely initial array index value of 0. Some other coutnign systems initialize at 1, such as the first value given to list item in an ordered list. We can of course declare that our ordered lists start with a 0, by using the start="0" attribute.</p>

	<p>The value of n in the css selectors :nth-child is 1 indexed and :nth-of-type is 0-indexed. We can think about it that any the first child of a parent is considered the first parent. Alternativly, :nth-of-type follows the formula (an + b)</p>

	<p>For example, below we see every third list item underlined, as per the style rule: li:nth-of-type(3n) { text-align: center; } </p>

	<p>Let's use the formula here: (an + b). For our style rule, b doesn't exist, so we can simplify the formula to something like (an), with a in this case being 3. Thus n starts at 0, and there is no "0th-of-type". We then increment n by 1 and have 3. We now select the li with the text content of "Third". We then increment n from 1 to 2 and target the li with the text content "Sixth". We then continue to increment until there are no more list items in range. </p>
