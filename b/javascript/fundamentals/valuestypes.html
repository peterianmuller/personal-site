    <h1>Values & Types AKA How Javascript Stores Information</h1>
    <p>Computers store information as data. Programs use data, and this data is contained within values. These values are stored to the computer's hardware memory at runtime.</p>
    <p>Values have different types. There are primitive data types:</p>

    <code class="prettyprint">
      <p>strings</p>
      <p>numbers</p>
      <p>booleans</p>
      <p>undefined</p>
      <p>null</p>
    </code>
    <p>There are also complex value types:</p>
    <code class="prettyprint">
      <p>plain objects</p>
      <p>arrays</p>
      <p>functions</p>
    </code>

    <p>Note that below, the data that appears after the comments
      are not visible to the programmer as is. They only exist in
      the computer's hardware </p>

    <p>If you ever want to see what type something is you can use the handy typeof() method.
    Note that the typeof operator will return a string with the type</p>
    <code class="prettyprint">
      typeof("cat"); // "string" <br>
      typeof(6); // "number"</br>
      typeof(true); // "boolean"</br>
      typeof(undefined); // "undefined" </br>
      typeof(null); // "object"</p>
    </code>

       <a href = "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18808226/why-is-typeof-null-object">More info</a> on why <code class="prettyprint">typeof(null); // object</code>
    <p>One way we create values is to type in the desired data into our program. This typing of the data is creating a "literal". When an interpreter finds our literal, a value is created in hardware memory which has a type and contains the data that we've written into the program.</p>
    <p>Whenever we type in a value, the interpreter saves it to a place in the computer memory with the type and the data contained by the value. Below are some examples of literals.</p>
    <p>String literal:</p>
    <code class="prettyprint">"Steph Curry"</code>
    <p>Type: String. Data: &quot;Steph Curry&quot;</p>
    <code class="prettyprint">300</code>
    <p>Type: number. Data: 300</p>

    <p>Type: Boolean. Data: false.</p>

     <p>Booleans are used to represent two-sided ideas: on vs off, weak vs. strong signal. The tradition of having opposing ideas such as these is central to computing and most languages have a stat type to model opposition. in this case using the words true and false. Note that with Booleans, there are no quotation marks around the data, yet the interpreter will not parse the data as a variable name. This is because true and false are special forms that the interpreter understands as Booleans and will treat them as such upon seeing them in code.</p>

    <p>A note about undefined and null.</p>

    <p><code class = "prettyprint">null;</code><p>
    <p>  type: Null, data: null</p>
    <p><code class = "prettyprint">undefined;</code></p>
    <p> type: undefined, data: undefined</p>


<p>null is a literal that represents an empty value and is normally set on purpose to reflect nothingness/non-existance.</p>

<p>Undefined is a value that is returned when no data has been set to that value. However the interpreter can return undefined when trying to access an unset property of a declared variable/object. For example:</p>


<p><code class ="prettyprint">
  var peter =; <br>
  console.log(peter); // undefined
</code></p>


    <p>A variable that is declared without pointing to any value carries the value undefined. Also, a function with no return statement will return the default value of undefined.</p>

    <p>However, like we've seen we can set a value to null on purpose to represent the idea of nothingness. Below we have a variable that we are actively setting to nothingness.</p>

    <p><code class ="prettyprint">
      var willTheWarriorsLoseTheFinals =null; <br>
      console.log(willTheWarriorsLoseTheFinals); // null;
    </code></p>


<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript">A dope breakdown of the crucial differences between undefined and null</a></p>

<p>Also note that the above values are saved to a computer's memory when a program is running. Once the program is done running, the values dissipate back into bits. These bits will later be used to form other values. </p>


    <p>So that's dope that Javascript saves all data as values with specific types. But what's the big deal about types? What have types done for me lately?</p>
    <p>One dope thing about types is integral methods that aid the type of work programers will do in reasoning about them. For example, the type Number includes with it math operators that aid the execution of mathmatical formulas.</p>
    <p>Let's say we want to do some math formulas. If we're using type Number, we get access to ready-made operators that perform basic math functions we all loved growing up with: <code class="prettyprint"> +, -, %, *</code></p>
    <code class="prettyprint">
      3 + 4; //7 <br>
      3 * 4; //12 <br>
      3 % 4; //1 WTF?
    </code>
    <p><code class="prettyprint">%</code> is our homie &quot;modulo&quot;, or &quot;remainder&quot;.</p>
      <code class="prettyprint">x % y</code> returns the remainder of dividing <code class="prettyprint">x</code> by <code class="prettyprint">y</code>.</p>

  <p><code class="prettyprint">7 % 5; //2. This is because 7/5 = 1 remainder 2. The remainder 2 is what we get back from the homie modulo.</code></p>


    <p>Note that the <code class="prettyprint">+</code> operator also performs differently if the data type is of type String and type Number.</p>
    <p>Another important thing about types is that the interpreter interprets types based on different rules.</p>
    <p>For example, let's think about <code class="prettyprint">/</code>. If we use this symbol in a string, than the interpreter understands that it's part of the string. However if we use <code class="prettyprint">/</code> in context of number literals than this symbol becomes a division operator.</p>
    <code class="prettyprint">
    <p> "10/5"; //"10/5" <br>
    <p>10 / 5; //2</p> </code>


    <p>Thus types provide us with different operators that reason about values in specific ways according to the type and also help guide the interpreter in it's evaluation of the data at hand.</p>
