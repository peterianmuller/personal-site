      <p>Goal: Expanding language understanding beyond basic &quot;nouns and sentence fragments&quot; we've seen so far (23)</p>
      <h2 id="expressions-and-statements">Expressions and Statements</h2>
      <p>An expressions is a &quot;Fragment of code that produces a value&quot; (23). Some examples of expressions:</p>
      <p>Values written out:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #009999">22</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;cat&quot;</span>

</pre>
      <p>Binary operators applied to two values/ urinary values applied to one value</p>

      <p>Because Javascript is a &quot;language-based interface&quot;, we can combine expressions to make more complicated computations (23). &quot;Expressions can nest in a way very similar to the way subsentences in human languages are nested - a subsentence can contain its own subsentences and so on,&quot;(23). In javascript we can combine expressions to express more complex operations.</p>
      <p>Let's see how we can go from using the functionality of the basic * operator to abstract out slightly more complex procedure.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #009999">3</span> * <span style="color: #009999">3</span>;

};

}

areaRightTri(<span style="color: #009999">3</span>,<span style="color: #009999">4</span>);

<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 12 here we&#39;ve used expressions including the * operator and the / operator to create the more complex idea of calculating the area of a triangle.</span>
</pre>

      <p>Haverbeke uses the analogy of an expression as a sentence fragment and as a statement as a full sentence. (24 top)</p>
      <p>If we place a semi-colon after an expression it becomes an &quot;expression statement&quot;, which is a vary basic type of statement.</p>

      <p>Note there are some expressions that can't be turned into expressions statements.</p>

</pre>

      <p>An expression is useful when it produces a value. However, a statement that simply produces a value, such as the expression statements above, don't really do anything other than create the value named in storage for the duration of the program.</p>
      <p>When a statement does something other than simply create a value, it is said to have &quot;side effects&quot; - anything more than simply naming a value to memory for a second (24).</p>
      <p>Examples of statements that have don't have side effects vs those that do have side effects:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #009999">7</span>;
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 7 (no side effect, simply creates the value in memory for runtime).</span>

</pre>


      <h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
      <p>So we've learned that we can create a value simply by typing it's name:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">true</span>;
<span style="color: #0000aa">false</span>;
<span style="color: #0000aa">NaN</span>;
<span style="color: #0000aa">undefined</span>;
</pre>

      <p>We can also create a value by typing the data we desire that will be saved as a specific type:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #009999">5</span>;
<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;cat&quot;</span>;
<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;&quot;</span>;
<span style="color: #009999">19</span>e3;
</pre>

      <p>&quot;To catch and hold values, Javascript provides a thing called a variable,&quot;(24). Note the use of &quot;catch and hold&quot; here and not &quot;a variable is equal to&quot; as variables often are in mathematics. Variables in Javascript &quot;point&quot; to values , &quot;They do not contain them, they grasp them - two variables can refer to the same value&quot; (25).</p>
      <p>We can create variables using another type of statement, a &quot;variable declaration statement&quot;, which involves using the keyword var followed by the name of the variable followed by the assignment operator = followed by the value that the vairable points to</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> pointsToANumber = <span style="color: #009999">17</span>;
</pre>

      <p>Note that we can set, or &quot;initialize&quot; a variable to a compound expression. all variables have to be resolved ot value on the right side of the assignment operator, so in this case our variable will be the result of the complex operator described:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> complexNumberOrNah = <span style="color: #009999">4</span> * <span style="color: #009999">3</span> + <span style="color: #009999">2</span>;
complexNumberOrNah;
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 14</span>
</pre>

      <p>Variable names can contain alphanumeric characters, must start with a number, but can contain $ and _ (25).</p>
      <p>Importante! &quot;When a variable points at a value, that does not mean it is tied to that value forever&quot;(25). We can use the = at any time to reassign the variable to point at a different value.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> weather = <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;sunny&quot;</span>;
weather = <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;cloudy&quot;</span>;

<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// &quot;cloudy&quot;</span>

<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// &quot;snowy&quot;</span>

      <p>EJS has a cool example of updating variables and debt by a friend who is really tryna get it together, Luigi:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> luigisDebt = <span style="color: #009999">140</span>;
luigisDebt = luigisDebt - <span style="color: #009999">35</span>;
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// Above the expression to the right of the = must be resolved to a value, so luigisDebt is converted to 140, the value it points to at that point.</span>

<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 105</span>
</pre>

      <p>All variables that are initialized but not given a value point to &quot;undefined&quot;. Also, we can declare multiple variables using one =</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> month = <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;January&quot;</span>, day = <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Monday&quot;</span>, date = <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;31st&quot;</span>;
<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;The month is &quot;</span> + month + <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;. The day is &quot;</span> + day + <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;, the &quot;</span> + date;
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// &quot;The month is January. The day is Monday, the 31st&quot;</span>
</pre>

      <h3>The Environment</h3>
      <p>&quot;The collection of variables and their values that exist at a given time is called the environment&quot; (26). While when we open our text editor it seems like a black page, but if we are programming in the browser environment there are hella variables already declared: such as console.log(), prompt(), confirm(), and a host of DOM stuff that is too long to list.</p>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>The values I've listed above are of type function. &quot;A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value&quot; (27). Functions can be thought of as mini (or sometimes not so mini) programs in themselves. When we use functions, this is called &quot;invoking, calling, or applying&quot; it. For example, when we apply the alert function, we should see a text box displaying the text we've written into the function:</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Good freakin&#39; morning&quot;</span>);
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// (Box pops up with a dope greeting)</span>
</pre>

      <p>When we invoke, the Values that we provide inside the () after the function name are called arguments (27). In the case above the alert function takes one argument of type string, though functions can take none, or many more and of several different types.</p>
      <h3>console.log()</h3>
      <p>The console.log() function is a way to make values passed as arguments visible to a console. Web browsers, Node.js, and several other javascript environments have consoles which can be used as a canvas to paint values passed to console.log().</p>
      <p>Note that we said variable names cannot contain punctuation other than $ and _. However, console.log &quot;is actually an expression that retrieves the log property from the value held by the console value.&quot; Thus, console.log() is more of a property access than a function per se, hence the inclusion of . in the variable name (27).</p>
      <h3>Return Values</h3>
      <p>Functions can do either or both of the following actions:</p>
        <p>Provide side effects (changing the world outside that function in some way. We've seen that the console.log function prints a value to a console. Alert pops up a text box. However, these functions technically carry no value (other than the default undefined))</p>

      <p>Return values. Functions can be useful in ways that don't necessarily change the outside world. Some examples of functions that return values but don't have side effects:</p>

      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #00aaaa">Math</span>.min(<span style="color: #009999">3</span>,<span style="color: #009999">100</span>);
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 3</span>
<span style="color: #00aaaa">Math</span>.sqrt(<span style="color: #009999">9</span>);
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 3</span>
</pre>

      <p>&quot;When a function produces a value, it is said to return that value. Anything that produces a value is an expression in Javascript, which means that function calls can be used within larger expressions&quot;(28). Thus, functions that return values can be expressions, or the sentence fragments that allow us to build larger and compare complex ideas.</p>
      <h3>Prompt and confirm</h3>
      <p>prompt is a built-in function that allows a program to ask the user a question via a pop-up box. There are two arguments, the 1st being the question and the second being the default text shown in the answer field (27).</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">prompt(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Who is your favorite Khardashian?&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Rob?&quot;</span>);
</pre>

      <p>confirm is a built-in function that provides a pop-up box with text as the first argument. The user then can choose OK or Cancel in response to the text. Ok gets parsed to boolean true, and Cancel to false.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> theNumber = <span style="color: #00aaaa">Number</span>(prompt(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Pick a number&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;&quot;</span>));
alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Your number is the cube root of &quot;</span> + theNumber * theNumber * theNumber);
</pre>

      <h2>Control Flow</h2>
      <p>While we have seen that multiple expressions can be nested inside of a statement, a statement is the end of reasoning on the expressions that make up that statement. The type of code we have seen until now, statements are interpreted top to bottom.</p>
      <p>Below this program has two statements that will be interpreted in order, from top to bottom.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> theNumber = <span style="color: #00aaaa">Number</span>(prompt(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Pick a number&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;&quot;</span>));
alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Your number is the cube root of &quot;</span> + theNumber * theNumber * theNumber);
</pre>

      <p>If we save the prompt function to a variable, the value that variable points to is the user's response. Also note that we are using the native function Number() that converts it's parameters to a number type. when a user provides input to prompt, that input is saved as type string so Number() will convert the string to a number (29).</p>
      <h3>Conditional Execution 1: if/else branches</h3>
      <p>Typically, we only want to execute code under certain circumstances and not just every statement in order from top to bottom. We can use various constructs to perform this conditional execution.</p>
      <p>We use Boolean values to determine if we take a branch set up by our code. Booleans are two-valued data, so in terms of choice they make sense to decide if we want to have our code take a certain action vs. another (29)</p>
      <p>In our previous program, we assumed that the user would pass a string that contains numeric characters that would be parsed into type number by the Number function.</p>
      <p>what if the user passes &quot;pizza&quot;? We can allow for this case to happen and respond with adequte code. As of yet there is no cube root for &quot;pizza&quot;.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> theNumber = <span style="color: #00aaaa">Number</span>(prompt(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Pick a number&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;&quot;</span>));
<span style="color: #0000aa">if</span> (!<span style="color: #00aaaa">isNaN</span>(theNumber))
alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Your number is the cube root of &quot;</span> + theNumber * theNumber * theNumber);
</pre>

      <p>Here, we've used an interesting trick to ensure no non-number input will pass through to the alert. isNaN() is a built in function like alert, prompt, etc. isNan() is passed a value and determines if that value is of type number, if not isNaN will return true. In our program above, we've placed the not operator before the expression of isNaN, so if theNumber is a number, !isNaN() will be true, allowing the program to enter the body of the if statement.</p>
      <p>However, we still haven't instructed our code to do something else if a number was not provided. We can use the handy keyword else for that.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> theNumber = <span style="color: #00aaaa">Number</span>(prompt(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Pick a number&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;&quot;</span>));
<span style="color: #0000aa">if</span> (!<span style="color: #00aaaa">isNaN</span>(theNumber))
  alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Your number is the cube root of &quot;</span> + theNumber * theNumber * theNumber);
<span style="color: #0000aa">else</span>
  alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Hey, why didn&#39;t you give me a number!?&quot;</span>);
</pre>

      <p>There is a third option for a branch between an if and else branch, which is an else if branch.</p>
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> choice = prompt(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;Pick a number from 1 to 10&quot;</span>,<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;...&quot;</span>);
<span style="color: #0000aa">if</span> (choice &lt; <span style="color: #009999">10</span>)
  alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;That&#39;s a small number&quot;</span>);
<span style="color: #0000aa">else</span> <span style="color: #0000aa">if</span> (choice &lt; <span style="color: #009999">100</span>)
  alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;That&#39;s a bit bigger&quot;</span>);
<span style="color: #0000aa">else</span>
  alert(<span style="color: #aa5500">&quot;That&#39;s big!!&quot;</span>);
</pre>

      <p>Above, the interpreter will receive an input for choice and than find the corresponding branch that has an expression in parenthesis that evaluates to true, starting with the if statement.</p>
      <h2 id="conditional-execution-2-looping-constructs">Conditional Execution 2: Looping constructs</h2>
      <h3 id="while-loops">while loops</h3>
      <p>We've looked at how a program can skip steps and dispatch on or choose a certain option based on a condition. However, what if we want a program to repeat a step over and over. I mean one of the power of a computer is the ability to compute operations with speed, so if we want the program to do something over and over again, there must be a more efficient way to do that other than the following. Let's write out a program that prints out all even numbers from 0 to 12</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">0</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">4</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">6</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">8</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">12</span>)<span class="op">;</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>&quot;That works, but the idea of writing a program is to make something less work, not more&quot; (31). Haverbeke bring up the point here that expanding this program to print out the numbers up to 1000 would be ridic, and it's true! Looping constructs are one the most basic examples of the powerful advantage a computer has: to be able to do many tasks super quickly. &quot;Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we where before and repeat it with our current program state,&quot; (31). Importantly here the state of the program changes according to the rules we set. Thus we don't have to manually write out each number for the program to instruct the computer to print. #automation at its finest.</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> number <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span>

      <p>When we start a statement with while, we are creating a loop. The expression inside the parenthesis that follows &quot;while&quot; checks if the following statement should be executed. If the expression in the () evaluates to true, the subsequent code will get executed.</p>
      <p>In the code above: 1) Interpreter encounters a variable declaration statement for number that points to 0. 2) Encounters while, so the interpreter knows things are about to get loopy. 3) Checks the expression in (). 4) If true, the program prints the current state of the variable number to a console and adds 2 to the variable number. 5) At this point the magic happens, and the code will return to the line with the expression in () and see if that expression still evaluates to true with the current state of the variable number. The program will then execute the statement following the loop if this expression evaluates to true. 6) Once the expression in the () evaluates to false, the program breaks out of the loop and moves to the line after the closing bracket of the loop.</p>
      <p>Also good to know - curly braces group statements together to count as a single statement. Just like multiple expressions inside a () count as a single expression (31).</p>
      <p>What's interesting about the loop above is that the same number that we want to print also keeps track of when we want to jump out of the loop. But many times, programs reason about numbers/data different than the number of times a program is supposed to repeat itself. For example let's use a loop to calculate 2^10:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> result <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="kw">var</span> counter <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="cf">while</span>(counter <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="dv">10</span>) <span class="op">{</span>
        result <span class="op">*=</span> <span class="dv">2</span><span class="op">;</span>
        counter <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="op">}</span>
      result<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="co">// 1024</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Here we've introduced the idea of a separate counter variable. I like to think of parallel processes going on here: the counting of repetitions, or &quot;iterations&quot; of the program and the work being done to achieve the original goal of the program. Note that our original goal of calculating 2^10 should not require us to think about a counter variable. Most all calculators have eliminated the need to tell the computer both the desired calculation (2^10) and the necessary iterations (10). We'll see later how we can hide, or abstract away, the need for a counter variable.</p>
      <h3 id="do-loops">do loops</h3>
      <p>do loops are similar to while loops, but they perform the statement that follows the conditional statement at least once.</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="cf">do</span> <span class="op">{</span>
        <span class="kw">var</span> name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="op">}</span> <span class="cf">while</span> (<span class="op">!</span>name)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(name)<span class="op">;</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>This is syntatically interesting. We're telling the interpreter to &quot;do(repeat) the prompt function while there is no valid name&quot; &quot;...The ! operator will convert a value to Boolean type before negating it, and all string except &quot;&quot; convert to true&quot; (32). Thus the while statement here will first convert the user input to a Boolean. The user input will be true if there is a non-empty string entered. Then the ! is applied and the expression with the valid string, which is true, will be negated to false. We know that conditional expressions that are false break out of loops, so a valid string's truthiness negated to falsiness allows the program to break out of the loop.</p>
      <p>Consider what happens when we omit the !:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="cf">do</span> <span class="op">{</span>
        <span class="kw">var</span> name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">prompt</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="op">}</span> <span class="cf">while</span> (name)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(name)<span class="op">;</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Here, the conditional expression will evaluate to true if there is a valid string entered, which will lead to repeated prompt functions. The only way to get the conditional expression to evaluate to false is to enter an empty string.<br />
      However, we want the user to enter a name, not an empty string.</p>
      <p>The do loop seems make sense for situations where looping might not be necessary if the code executes as desired the first time it is run. Alternatively, the while loop needs the looping behavoir to successfully execute the code. There's no way to print out 2^10 using iteration without a loop repeating itself.</p>
      <h3 id="for-loops">for Loops</h3>
      <p>There is a common pattern of loops that require a counter variable to keep track of hoe many times a loop needs to repeat until the work of a program is done. Anytime prorgrammers find that a behavoir is repeated many times, there is an effort to create a construct to make that behavoir more easy for programmer to perform - Abstraction!</p>
      <p>the for Loop, in this case the for-in loop, has a way to biuld in a counter variable into the body of the loop so it becomes unnecessary (and messy) to declare a counter variable in the code before the loop.</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="kw">var</span> number <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span> number <span class="op">&lt;=</span> <span class="dv">12</span><span class="op">;</span> number <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)
        <span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(number)<span class="op">;</span>
      <span class="co">// 0</span>
      <span class="co">// 2</span>
      <span class="co">// etc.</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>The conditional expression that follows the for keyword contains two ;. The first expression declares the coutner variable. The second expression (after the first ;) checks to see if the loop should repeat or if the code should break out of the code. This second expression is what would be found in the () after the while loop. the third expression updates the &quot;state of the loop after each iteration&quot; (33). Note that the updating happens after the work of the loop is done.</p>
      <p>2^10 with for loop:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">var</span> result <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span>

      <h3 id="the-break-statement">the break statement</h3>
      <p>So we know a few ways to break out of a loop. - while (false) - When second expression in () for a for loop evaluates to false.</p>
      <p>However there is a way to break out of a loop without filling in the second expression in the () after the for keyword.</p>
      <p>Let's say we want to find the first number divisible by 7 starting from 20 and increasing by 1. Lol this is like the coding version of Spanish textbooks teaching you how to say &quot;I'd like three mangos, Juan&quot;.</p>

      <p>Once the input is provided, the code will search for the case that matches the input and then execute the code that follows the matching case. The interpreter will jump out of the switch statement once it encounters a break statement (35). Note that not every case needs a break statement. In the code above if the user did not step into a puddle, two messages will be printed to the console: &quot;Way to go!&quot; and &quot;You're lucky&quot;!</p>
      <p>Note: There are notes on capitalization and comments in EJS that you can check out here.</p>
      <h2 id="summary">Summary!</h2>
      <p>Programs are made of statements that are themselves made of statements. Remember curly braces can wrap several statements into one block and will be counted as a single statement. Statements are built of expressions. (37).</p>
      <p>When we place statements one after another, they are executed as such. We have seen two methods to disrupt the flow of control: - conditional statements: if else switch - looping statements: for while do</p>
      <p>Variables allow the program to save values to memory and to &quot;track state&quot; in a program. Variables and the values they point to are called &quot;the environment&quot;. JavaScript comes with built in variables, such as console.log(), typeof(), etc.</p>
      <p>We looked at some basic functions. Functions are programs wrapped in values. They manipulate data but are data themselves!!! Doughnuts that make more doughnuts. Functions can be invoked, called, or applied by writing the following:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="at">functionName</span>(arguments)<span class="op">;</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Since the above function invocation ends in a ; it is an expression. Function expressions may produce values, side effects, or both (37).</p>
