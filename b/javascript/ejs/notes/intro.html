<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In his discussion of what a computer program is, Marijin Haverbeke describes that, &quot;A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer; it is the directing force that makes the computer do what it does; it is data in the computer's memory, yet it controls the actions performed on this same memory.&quot; (3).</p>
<p>It's really trippy that programs are data themselves that reason about other data, and this concept throws a wrench in the ost-employed real world analogy of a physical machine as a computer program.Haverbeke continues: &quot;A superficially fitting (analogy) is that of a machine- lots of separate parts tend to be involved, and to make the whole thing tick, we have to consider the ways in which these parts interconnect and contribute to the whole.&quot; (3).</p>
<p>What is perhpas more clear than a program-as-machine example, is the computer-as-machine example, with the computer: &quot;//built to act as host for these immaterial machnines&quot; (Haverbeke 3).</p>
<p>Indeed, the computer is a containing machine that holds programs, which are thought of as machines themselves. However, because programs reason about data that they themslves are made of, it's tough for me to fully appreciate the amchine analaogy for programs. It's like a doughnut maker was a doughnut itself.</p>
<p>I think it's beside the point to hammer on the doughnut example and instead appreciate the available accessible similarities between physical machines and invisible computer programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Machines have separate parts - Programs are built of modules that are designed to fufill a unique purpose of the program.</p></li>
<li><p>But these separate parts work together - Programs share global variables, the same global environment and sometimes modules need to communicate with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Machines need an on button - Programs use semi colons and function invocation to initiate, continue execution.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programming-as-controlling-complexity">Programming as controlling complexity</h2>
<p>The author describes a cnetral axiom of prgramming as control: &quot;The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity&quot; (3).</p>
<p>Controlling complexity is the goal of programming and is a central theme for other teachers of the subject:</p>
<p>&quot;The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity&quot; Ableson et al stress the importance of understanding &quot;...the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems&quot; (Ableson, et al xxii).</p>
<p>&quot;The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he [sic] alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs&quot; (Weizenbaum, cited in Haverbeke 2).</p>
<p>So it seems that its not that computers or programs are complex by nature, but instead the universes we create are complex, and programmers must learn how to control that complexity in order to have a functional virtual universe.</p>
<h2 id="why-language-matters">Why Language Matters</h2>
<p>Haverbeke stresses that programs can be presented in various ways: less or more readable, more or less understandable to the programmer's eye in addition to functionally sound.</p>
<p>The evolution of a program from unreadable and confusing to readable and more straightforward is described in the introduction. The goal of the program in questio nremaisn the same throughout the progression - code that computes the sum of the numbers 1 to 10, the first example is binary:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">
<span class="dv">00110001</span> <span class="dv">00000000</span> <span class="dv">00000000</span>
<span class="dv">00110001</span> <span class="dv">00000001</span> <span class="dv">00000001</span>
<span class="dv">00110011</span> <span class="dv">00000001</span> <span class="dv">00000010</span>
<span class="dv">01010001</span> <span class="dv">00001011</span> <span class="dv">00000010</span>
<span class="dv">00100010</span> <span class="dv">00000010</span> <span class="dv">00001000</span>
<span class="dv">01000011</span> <span class="dv">00000001</span> <span class="dv">00000000</span>
<span class="dv">01000001</span> <span class="dv">00000001</span> <span class="dv">00000001</span>
<span class="dv">00010000</span> <span class="dv">00000010</span> <span class="dv">00000000</span>
<span class="dv">01100010</span> <span class="dv">00000000</span> <span class="dv">00000000</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that to even decipher what the above program is tryign to achieve we would need to speak binary. Binary fluency could unmask the instructions of the previous program and transcribe them to English as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">
<span class="dv">1</span>. <span class="at">Store</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">number</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="kw">in</span> memory location <span class="dv">0</span>.
<span class="dv">2</span>. <span class="at">Store</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">number</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="kw">in</span> memory location <span class="dv">1</span>.
<span class="dv">3</span>. <span class="at">Store</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">value</span> <span class="at">of</span> <span class="at">memory</span> <span class="at">location</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="kw">in</span> memory location <span class="dv">2</span>.
<span class="dv">4</span>. <span class="at">Subtract</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">number</span> <span class="dv">11</span> <span class="im">from</span> the value <span class="kw">in</span> memory location <span class="dv">2</span>.
<span class="dv">5</span>. <span class="at">If</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">value</span> <span class="at">in</span> <span class="at">memory</span> <span class="at">location</span> <span class="dv">2</span> is the number <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">,</span>
   <span class="cf">continue</span> <span class="cf">with</span> instruction <span class="dv">9</span>.
<span class="dv">6</span>. <span class="at">Add</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">value</span> <span class="at">of</span> <span class="at">memory</span> <span class="at">location</span> <span class="dv">1</span> to memory location <span class="dv">0</span>.
<span class="dv">7</span>. <span class="at">Add</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">number</span> <span class="dv">1</span> to the value of memory location <span class="dv">1</span>.
<span class="dv">8</span>. <span class="at">Continue</span> <span class="at">with</span> <span class="at">instruction</span> <span class="dv">3</span>.
<span class="dv">9</span>. <span class="at">Output</span> <span class="at">the</span> <span class="at">value</span> <span class="at">of</span> <span class="at">memory</span> <span class="at">location</span> <span class="dv">0</span>.</code></pre></div>
<p> It's clearly easier to decipher this example than the binary. The author of this program has included places to store information as &quot;memory location 0&quot; , &quot;memory location 1&quot;, and &quot;memory location 2&quot;.  There are numbers stored in these various places and we manipulate these numbers to achieve our goal through a fairly confusing set of rules that involve repeating certain steps of the program based on the condition or "state" of the memory locations.</p>
<p> The program stores numbers in memory locations  in steps 1-3 and subtracts 11 from the number stored in memory location 2. Step 6 adds the value of the current number (1, 2, 3, etc) to the &quot;total&quot;, which has been assinged to &quot;memory location 0&quot;. Step 7 increments &quot;count&quot; or &quot;memory location 1&quot; by 1. Step 8 loops again. Step 9 only happens once '11 - &quot;memory location 2&quot; = 0' or, if we've looped through the program 10 times. At this point, we print out our grand total.</p>
<p>The previous program has more readable instructions than the binary code. However our original goal of adding numbers shouldn't require the user to involve themselves with "memory locations", if possible. What if we replaced names of our storage locations like &quot;memory location 0&quot; with what those places actually represent for the universe of our program?</p>
<p>EJS has the following less unreadable code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">Set “total” to <span class="dv">0</span>.
Set “count” to <span class="dv">1</span>.
[loop]
Set “compare” to “count”.
Subtract <span class="dv">11</span> <span class="im">from</span> “compare”.
If “compare” is zero<span class="op">,</span> <span class="cf">continue</span> at [end].
Add “count” to “total”.
Add <span class="dv">1</span> to “count”.
Continue at [loop].
[end]
Output “total”.</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we're cooking! &quot;total&quot;, &quot;count&quot;, and &quot;compare&quot; denote not just a place or space in memory, but the role of that place in our program. However, there are details that are more complex than simply adding numbers from 1 to 10. Fo example, we're using a counter variable that counts how many times we've looped through the function. "Looping" is a detail that we shouldn't have to worry about in our program, we simply want to add the numbers 1 to 10, looping be damned! Let's check out the program in JavaScript and see if it's more readable:</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">var</span> total = <span style="color: #009999">0</span>, count = <span style="color: #009999">1</span>;
<span style="color: #0000aa">while</span> (count &lt;= <span style="color: #009999">10</span>) {
total += count;
count += <span style="color: #009999">1</span>;
}
console.log(total);
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 55 </span>
</pre>


</code>
<p>Ok dope! So there's no more &quot;loop&quot; written out (Haverbeke 4), and there are only two variables instead of 3. Additionally, there are less lines of code, which is always better is functionality is the same.</p>
<p>Could there really be any more simple ways of finding the sum of the numbers 1-10?</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">console.log(sum(range(<span style="color: #009999">1</span>,<span style="color: #009999">10</span>)));
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">// 55 </span>
</pre>


</code>
<p>Holy Smokes! Here we have no variables at all, no incrementing or decrementing, no looping! We have made what was a vary complex set of instructions that required fluency in binary into what is &quot;...almost English&quot;.</p>
<p>This shows that if can omit &quot;uninteresting details&quot; like memory locations, looping, superfluous variables, than our programs can be more readable to the human eye. Note that the computer doesn't really care about more readable programs. With the correct interpreter all of these examples would produce the same computational result. However, the human communicative efficiency of the latter program is readily apparent.</p>
<h2 id="programs-as-building-blocks">Programs as building blocks</h2>
<p>One way of looking at programming is to understand it as a process of building blocks that each control a certain level of complexity, with increasing complexity added with each block. Haverbeke goes in about the incremental creation of programs at the bottom of page 5:</p>
<p>&quot;A good programming language...provides convenient building blocks (such as  <span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">while</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">console.log()</span>), allows you to define your own building blocks (such as sum and range), and makes those blocks easy to compose.&quot;</p>
<p>This idea of building up a program based on solid blocks is akin to Abelson's idea about this feature's attraction in the Lisp language:</p>
<p>&quot;(Step-by-step program construction) encourages the incremental development and testing of programs and is largely responsible for the fact that a Lisp program usually consists of a large number of relatively simple procedures (Ableson et al 11)&quot;.</p>
<p>A quick examples of using building blocks that deal with increasingly complex ideas to form more complex programs.</p>
<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000aa">function</span> sum(x,y) {
<span style="color: #0000aa">return</span> x + y;
}
<span style="color: #0000aa">function</span> square(x) {
<span style="color: #0000aa">return</span> x * x;
}
<span style="color: #0000aa">function</span> sumOfSquares(x,y) {
<span style="color: #0000aa">return</span> sum(square(x), square(y));
}
sumOfSquares(<span style="color: #009999">2</span>,<span style="color: #009999">3</span>);
<span style="color: #aaaaaa; font-style: italic">//13</span>
</pre>

<p>In our final sumOfSquares API we have written out uninteresting details of addition and squaring. All the user needs to know is the two numbers they would like to square and then add together.</p>
<h2> Issues with &quot;Liberal&quot; JavaScript.</h2>
<p>Javascript is &quot;liberal&quot; which means it allows many computations within programs that other languages won't allow ( Haverbeke 6). This is a double edged sword:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Liberal: Many things allowed, less obvious errors</p></li>
<li><p>Liberal: Many things allowed, more diverse solutions to problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Haverbeke also describes JavaScript's growth from a language that was only in the web browser to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li><p>being used in databases: MongoDB and CouchDB</p></li>
<li><p>Available to some desktop/server programming with node.js</p></li>
</ol>
