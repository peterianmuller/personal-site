<p>JavaScript is a liberal language that allows the programmer to pass in values that could lead to undesired outcomes. For example, the JS interpreter has a tendency to convert values to other types based on what it thinks the program should read.</p>
<p>Haverbeke has an excellent explanation of this on page 18.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">
<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="dv">5</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="kw">null</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="co">// 5</span>

<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&#39;5&#39;</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="co">// 4</span>

<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&#39;5&#39;</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="co">// 51</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first example changes the value <code>null</code> to <code>0</code> and then completes the addition operation. However, <code>null</code> is not typically meant to be added to another value as if it were an integer.</p>
<p>Next we see that the string <code>'5'</code> has been converted to a number and the result is <code>4</code>, which is the correct result of the operation had we passed in <code>5 + 1</code>.</p>
<p>The final example here has the same operands, but we've changed the operator to <code>+</code>. There is a <code>+</code> for strings which will result in string concatenation - a process very different from addition of numbers.</p>
<p>Some more examples</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript">
<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&#39;five&#39;</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="kw">null</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="co">// fivenull</span>

<span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="st">&#39;five&#39;</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="kw">null</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
<span class="co">// NaN</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here the first example results in a stringification of <code>null</code> so that the interpreter can complete a string concatenation of <code>'five'</code> and <code>'null'</code>, resulting in 'fivenull'. The second example contains the same operands yet results in <code>NaN</code>, which makes sense. We can't reason about strings using the <code>-</code> operator, so the calculation <code>'five' - null</code> doesn't really make sense.</p>
<p>The conclusion that Haverbeke makes for type coercion is that when we pass a value to an operator that we don't mean to use, such as <code>'5' + 1</code> if we want to do addition and not string concatenation, JS will &quot;quietly convert that value to the type it wants&quot;(18).</p>
<p>Hence, we should be careful when passing different value types into functions and operations because we won't always be able to predict what JavaScript will decide our values should be converted to.</p>
