<p>We can use the following evaluation rules to see how the global enviornment is not a blank canvas, but instead already populated with relevant procedures. Pretty much all programs come with built in properties/methods/functions that are useful.</p>
<p>Evaluation of primitves done by understanding the following 3 rules: - the values of the numerals are indeed the numerals they are (4 is 4 and not 5) - the built-in operators perform the tasks we assume them to. (+ 4 5) is assumed to add the numerals 4 and 5 together. - the values of the other names are those that we have defined in the enviornment of our program. pi is equal to the number 3.14 via our definition. The primitive operators have all been saved to the enviornment before we've even opened our Racket file.</p>
<p>The idea that the global enviornment comes with built in functions/commands is also explained by EJS. console.log() is assumed ot do what it does and we have access to that function upon creating our js file.</p>
<p>Global Enviornment is not an empty canvas, just like Microsoft Word. Word comes with built-in functions to utilize text attributes so the user doesn't have to worry about creating that function.</p>
<p>Important to understand that the enviornemnt in which we are performing our program determines the behavoir of our program. Local variables/Global variables are a central theme of CS.</p>
<p>Key point! The enviornment plays a role in determing what the symbols we use to reason about data mean. The + operator performs addition because it has been programmed to do so in the global enviornment (14). The italic attribute in Microsoft Word has been programed to do so and not bold the text.</p>
