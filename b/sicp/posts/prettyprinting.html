<p>;;Why pretty printing is helpful to see the operators and operands.</p>
<p>(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6)) ;;The plus sign is the operator and it's operands are the compound expressions that starts with (<em>... and (+.... One level more nested into the top nested expression , the (+ is the operator and the operands are the compound expressions (</em> 2 4) and (+ 3 5). Under this expression, the operator (+ (- 10 7) and 6 are the operands. Note that we could align more simple expressions this way as well:</p>
<p>;;Above, the operator * takes the operands 4 and 5. Let's bulid this up. We'll see how we can keep arranging the operands vertically ;;in respect to the operators.</p>
<p>(+ 48 9)</p>
<p>(+ (* 3 16) 9)</p>
<p>;;One more step:</p>
<p>(+ (* 3 (+ 8 8)) (+ 3 6))</p>
<p>;;And finally:</p>
<p>(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6))</p>
<p>;;All the while the operators are aligned vertically. All of these values can be resolved to a value.</p>
