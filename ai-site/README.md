We currently have a working template. Major differences between this code and the code that is on the site is that all leading "/" in resources located in other directors have been removed here. For example: on

info.html original

<li><a href="https://thehill-side.com/" target="_blank"><img src="/nc_assets/img/AI-pics/TheHill-Side.png"></a></li>

info.html off-line

<li><a href="https://thehill-side.com/" target="_blank"><img src="nc_assets/img/AI-pics/TheHill-Side.png"></a></li>

8/22 -> Move icon to top of info page. Can scroll down to info page
