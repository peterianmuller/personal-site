<p>We can use array methods for strings! Check out Josh Clayton's wonderful and indepth <a href="http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/using-javascripts-array-methods-on-strings.html">article about htis very topics</a>. The example I provide is a basic application of the possibilites explained by Clayton.</p>
<p>A recent codewars challange by sensei petegarvin1 (shoutsout!) challanged us to create a function to take in a string of number characters and return a string with all characters that are numbers 5 or less converted into 0's and 5 and above converted to 1's. My solution:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode javascript"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span class="kw">function</span> <span class="at">fakeBin</span>(x)<span class="op">{</span>
   <span class="cf">return</span> [].<span class="va">map</span>.<span class="at">call</span>(x<span class="op">,</span> <span class="kw">function</span>(item) <span class="op">{</span> <span class="cf">return</span> item <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;5&#39;</span> <span class="op">?</span> <span class="st">&#39;0&#39;</span> : <span class="st">&#39;1&#39;</span> <span class="op">}</span>).<span class="at">join</span>(<span class="st">&#39;&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span>
 <span class="op">};</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But <code>x</code> is a string and there's no <code>x.split()</code>!! Because we are technically invoking <code>.map()</code> on an array, the interpeter is ok with this. However, then we bind the this context to our string as we pass in the x parameter as the first argument to call. This tells <code>.map()</code> to do work on the string, and we pass our anonymous function as the second argument to call, which will refer to the first argument to <code>.map()</code>.</p>
